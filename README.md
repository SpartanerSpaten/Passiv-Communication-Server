# Passiv-Communication-Server

Is my personal solution for avoiding to dig a hole in my router.

You Need https://github.com/oktal/pistache and https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson installed in yoursystem
futhermore a file called token.txt which where you put your auth token.

### Installation / Build

     $ git clone 

     $ mkdir build & cd build

     $ cmake ../

     $ make

     $ touch token.txt

     $ nano token.txt

Now insert your auth token into the first line

     $ ./C_API

Run the binary

Experimental Dockerfile will come soon
